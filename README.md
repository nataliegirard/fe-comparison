This repository is intended to be used to compare front-end frameworks. 

Starting from the tutorial at [tutsplus](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/comparing-front-end-frameworks),
updating to newer version of the frameworks, and changing to a different style. More features will be added
to do filtering, sorting, and searching of the contact list.

Comparing:
- Backbone.js
- Angular.js
- React.js
- Ember.js

The comparison will look at the page load speeds for each framework on a simple address book application.

To run each framework separately:
- run `npm install` and `bower install`
- start node/express server using `bin/www`
- navigate the browser to localhost
- load each different front-end framework by navigating to their URLs (eg. to see the angular app, go to `/angular`)
