This repository is intended to be used to compare front-end frameworks. 

Starting from the tutorial at tutsplus: https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/comparing-front-end-frameworks

Comparing:
- Backbone.js
- Angular.js
- React.js
- Ember.js


The comparison will look at the page load speeds for each framework on a simple address book application.
