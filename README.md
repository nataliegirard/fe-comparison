This repository is intended to be used to compare front-end frameworks.

**This project is no longer being maintained and should not be used as an example of good modern coding practices.**

This project was inspired by a tutorial at [tutsplus](https://code.tutsplus.com/courses/comparing-front-end-frameworks).

Comparing:
- Backbone.js
- Angular.js
- React.js
- Ember.js

The comparison will look at the page load speeds for each framework on a simple address book application.

To run each framework separately:
- run `npm install` and `bower install`
- start node/express server using `bin/www`
- navigate the browser to `localhost:3000` or to whatever port was specified
- load each different front-end framework by navigating to their URLs (eg. to see the angular app, go to `/angular`)
